### Login into Controller 

The controller is the "brain" of a Datacol stack. A controller manages applications and their containers.

`datacol login` makes it easy to share your stack with anyone on your team or switch between different stacks. Once you create a stack we will provide you the IP address and password of the controller.

You can then type correct password and login/switch into a stack using -

    datacol login --ip <12.34.34.45>
    Enter Password: ****
